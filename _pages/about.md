I am an assistant professor of Computer Science at Brandeis University. I work at the intersection of designing data layouts and access methods for storage engines and developing systems-level solutions for privacy protection in modern data systems. The goal of my research is to design efficient privacy-aware data systems by navigating the privacy-performance tradeoff and designing privacy-aware data structures and algorithms that supports <i>privacy by design</i>. My research interests span data systems, storage layouts, access methods, and their intersection with data privacy.

Before joining Brandeis, I was a post-doctoral associate at Boston University in the [Data-intensive Systems and Computing (DiSC) lab](https://disc.bu.edu/) with Manos Athanassoulis (2019-2023). Prior to that, I spent two years at Inria, Rennes (France) a post-doctoral researcher with Christine Morin (2017-2018). I got my PhD in Computer Science from IIT Kharagpur in 2017. 

<h5><b>Prospective students and post-docs</b></h5>
I am recruiting motivated PhD students and post-docs for Fall 2023.
